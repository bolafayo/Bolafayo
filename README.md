## Hi there, I'm Bolade Olufayo ğŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer with a passion for tech and building responsive website. I'm currently focused on mastering frontend development and studying Software Engineering in Lead City University. I enjoy making and designing webpages with HTML and CSS (and possibly JavaScript in the future). My love for tech keeps me committed to both the beauty and chaos it brings. Music makes my life better and I believe I can learn anything I truly want to learn.


ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, javaScript
ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating webpages and learning how to progam.
ğŸ˜€ I like to code, read, and sleep.
âš¡ Fun fact:  I talk to my code like it can hear meâ€¦ and sometimes, it listens.
